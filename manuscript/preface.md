# Preface

One day, Neil Degrasse Tyson's Cosmos was running on TV, and my 3 year old got curious about the apple falling down. 
And so I explained how there was this invisible thing called *gravity* which pulls things down. The apple fell down
because gravity pulled it down. A few days later, I was helping my toddler in the restroom, and my son asked me:
"Dad, Do you know why my pee goes down?". He paused and responded with a twinkle in his eyes, "Because of Gravity!".

That little episode was an eye opener for me. I did not expect him to remember that little fact, let alone apply 
to things around him. And so I was started experimenting on how I can talk science to my toddler in ways he can
relate to. I decided to pen this down with the hope that it will be useful to other parents.

#### Who is this book meant for?

This is not a book that you would read to your kids at night. This is a book for parents who want to 
talk science to their kids, but not sure where to start. In this book, I will break down each concept
into little chapters, and propose questions for discussion.

#### What is the intent?

This book is about talking science as opposed to teaching science. Teaching science can be pedagogical, where
as talking science is conversational. This book is meant to help you start a conversation with your kids about 
science and just get them thinking.

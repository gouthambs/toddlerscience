# Preface

One day, Neil Degrasse Tyson's Cosmos was running on TV, and my 3 year old got curious about the apple falling down. 
And so I explained how there was this invisible thing called **gravity** which pulls things down. The apple fell down
because gravity pulled it down. A few days later, I was helping my toddler in the restroom, and he son asked me:
"Dad, Do you know why my pee goes down?". He paused and responded with a twinkle in his eyes, "Because of Gravity!".

That little episode was an eye opener for me. I did not expect him to remember that little fact let alone apply that 
little fact around him. And so I was started experimenting on how I can talk science to my toddler.
